# ML_mutational_learning
__Prediction of mutations in receptor binding domain  allowed it to  escape from antibodies.__
First experiments. 
1. Notebooks/onehot_encode - 1d conv over one-hot encoded protein sequences
2. Notebooks/physics_features - 1d conv over physics features (obtained from https://github.com/gitter-lab/nn4dms) protein sequences
