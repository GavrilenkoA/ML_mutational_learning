### Antibody escape prediction of mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants.

**Problem statement:**

Since the origin of SARS-Cov2, there has been enough data on RBD variants and their effect on the immune system - whether antibodies bind this variant of RBD or not (binary classification problem).

Machine learning models may be used for predictive profiling on current and prospective variants RBD guide the development of therapeutic antibody treatments and vaccines for COVID-19.

Detailed molecular analysis has revealed that many neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 share sequence and structural features. In can be used as a additional data source for pretraining machine learning models for prediction binding RBD with limited labeled data of the antibody of interest. 

In this part of project I implemented fine-tuning approach adding a feature to the RBD sequence with which antibody it interacts. Fine-tuning model used for prediction of binding by therapeutic antibody REGN33.

**Results:**

Training RNN model consists of two stages:
1. pre-training using background antibododies
2. fine tuning for prediction of REGN33 antibody escape.

Then I provide 40 experiments, sampling different random 100 RBD sequences neutralized by REGN33 antibodies for fine-tuning and compare performance of base model and fine-tuning model, using paired T-test.

#### Conclusion: 
Therapeutic antibodies share similar features - they target the conserved epitopes on RBD and mutations in the same manner reflected by binding RBD and can be used as a data source for pre-training ML models for prediction antibody escape with limited labeled data of antibody of interest.
