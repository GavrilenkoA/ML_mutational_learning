### Antibody escape prediction of mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants 
#### Purpose and objectives of the project
##### Purpose:
** Develop an algorithm which can perform better in condition with few data mutated variants using fine-tuning technique.
##### Objectives:
** Reproduce the article https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.07.471580 - classification antibody escape (only LY15 antibody) using random forest and LSTM models.
** Merge the data of mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants with four antibodies into one dataframe.
